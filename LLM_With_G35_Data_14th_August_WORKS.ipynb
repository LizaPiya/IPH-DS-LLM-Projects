He has multiple plaques and in no innumerable Dawson's fingers which are consistent with a history of multiple sclerosis.^^Brain stem auditory evoked potential studies done on December 20, 2016 were normal.^^Visual evoked potential studies done on the same day revealed findings consistent with mild to moderate left optic neuropathy which remains unchanged when compared to the study done in July 2015.^^^^MRI scan of the brain done without and with contrast on March 15, 2018 revealed no interval change in the moderate demyelinating plaque burden of multiple sclerosis. There are no new enhancing or nonenhancing lesions.^^Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies done on April 10, 2018 are normal.^^Somatosensory evoked potential studies of the upper and lower extremities done on the same day are also normal.^^Visual evoked potential studies done on April 10, 2018 are abnormal indicative of mild left optic neuropathy. Compared to the previous study done in December 2016 there has been mild improvement on the left.^^^^Blood tests done by her rheumatologist Dr. Kleiner on May 31, 2019 revealed beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies, immunoglobulin panels, B12 and folic acid levels, thyroid function test, sedimentation rate, CMP, LDH, magnesium levels, phosphorus levels, complement levels, C-reactive protein, immunofixation CBC, anticardiolipin antibodies ,which were all normal.^^Blood tests done on July 10, 2019 revealed normal CMP and CBC with slightly low CD8 lymphocytes.^^^^EMG and nerve conduction studies of the upper extremities done on August 28, 2019 revealed severe right carpal tunnel syndrome and moderately severe left carpal tunnel syndrome.^^MRI scan of the brain done without contrast on July 21, 2021 reveals no change in the patient's multiple sclerosis when compared to the prior study.^^MRI scan of the cervical spine done on July 14, 2021 reveals single demyelinating lesion in the cervical cord at C5-6.^^MRI scan of the thoracic spine done on the same day is normal.^^Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies done on August 25, 2021 are normal.

She states that she recently had right eye laser surgery for retinal tear. She has been followed by Dr. Edward Barron the neuro-ophthalmologist. She has been noticing that she has been experiencing left-sided headaches and some pain in the eye over the past few months. She had been on tapering dose of prednisone and was supposed to increase amitriptyline to 80 mg. However she has been taking only 70 mg at bedtime.

There is no abnormal area of enhancement.^^Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies done on 12/5/13 were normal.^^Otoacoustic admissions studies done on 12/5/13 revealed peripheral hearing loss worse on the right when compared to the left.^^Somatosensory evoked potential studies of the upper and lower extremities done on the same date to my review are normal.^^Visual evoked potential studies done on 12/5/13 showed mild-to-moderate left optic neuropathy which is unchanged from the prior study.^^^^MRI scan of the thoracic spine done on October 28, 2015 is normal.^^Blood tests done by her rheumatologist on October 13, 2015 revealed normal CBC and CMP. Her B12 and folic acid levels were normal. She had normal CPK levels. Her serum electrophoresis was also normal. However the patient had a positive anticardiolipin antibody titers as well as elevated ENA.^^^^MRI scan of the brain done without and with contrast on November 30, 2016 revealed no significant interval change. He has multiple plaques and in no innumerable Dawson's fingers which are consistent with a history of multiple sclerosis.^^Brain stem auditory evoked potential studies done on December 20, 2016 were normal.^^Visual evoked potential studies done on the same day revealed findings consistent with mild to moderate left optic neuropathy which remains unchanged when compared to the study done in July 2015.^^^^MRI scan of the brain done without and with contrast on March 15, 2018 revealed no interval change in the moderate demyelinating plaque burden of multiple sclerosis. There are no new enhancing or nonenhancing lesions.^^Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies done on April 10, 2018 are normal.^^Somatosensory evoked potential studies of the upper and lower extremities done on the same day are also normal.^^Visual evoked potential studies done on April 10, 2018 are abnormal indicative of mild left optic neuropathy. Compared to the previous study done in December 2016 there has been mild improvement on the left.^^^^Blood tests done by her rheumatologist Dr. Kleiner on May 31, 2019 revealed beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies, immunoglobulin panels, B12 and folic acid levels, thyroid function test, sedimentation rate, CMP, LDH, magnesium levels, phosphorus levels, complement levels, C-reactive protein, immunofixation CBC, anticardiolipin antibodies ,which were all normal.^^Blood tests done on July 10, 2019 revealed normal CMP and CBC with slightly low CD8 lymphocytes.^^^^EMG and nerve conduction studies of the upper extremities done on August 28, 2019 revealed severe right carpal tunnel syndrome and moderately severe left carpal tunnel syndrome.^^MRI scan of the brain done without contrast on July 21, 2021 reveals no change in the patient's multiple sclerosis when compared to the prior study.^^MRI scan of the cervical spine done on July 14, 2021 reveals single demyelinating lesion in the cervical cord at C5-6.^^MRI scan of the thoracic spine done on the same day is normal.^^Brainstem auditory evoked potential studies done on August 25, 2021 are normal. Somatosensory evoked potential studies done on the same day are abnormal with central conduction delay.^^Visual evoked response study done on the same day shows mild to moderate bilateral optic neuropathy which is mildly worsened^^^^MR angiography of the brain done without contrast on 10/9/2021 is normal.\n",
